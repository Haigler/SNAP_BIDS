**.Nii to BIDs**

The raw DICOMs were anonymized and converted to BIDS format using the following procedure (for more details, seehttps://github.com/Haigler/SNAP_BIDS/). 

1. Deidentifying DICOMS: Batch Anonymization of the DICOMS using DicomBrowser (https://nrg.wustl.edu/software/dicom-browser/) 

2. Conversion to .nii and BIDS structure: Anonymized DICOMs were converted to .nii and put into BIDS structure using dicm2nii (https://github.com/xiangruili/dicm2nii). 

3. Defacing .nii: PAMD anatomical .nii were defaced with pydeface (https://github.com/poldracklab/pydeface).

4. BIDS Validation: The full PAMD dataset was validated using bids-validator (https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator).
